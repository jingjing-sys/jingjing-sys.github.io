                Graduated from the High School Affiliated to Capital Normal
                University CGPA3.80 Freeman of Volleyball Player I am an
                optimistic, positive, patient and responsible person. In life, I
                am good at listening to othersâ€™ suggestions and reflecting on
                myself and helping others solve problems. When I was in high
                school, because I liked art, I participated in school club
                activities many times and represented the school in art
                competitions and won the city honor. My specialty is volleyball,
                painting and singing. I have been learning volleyball since
                junior high school and have won some awards. I also like sports
                very much. I think a lot of exercise can exercise my
                perseverance and endurance.

            I hope I can become a responsible and appealing educator. I long for
            my students to gain knowledge from me, find their own value and make
            progress with me. We all know that the factor of a good teacher is
            that we can mobilize the enthusiasm of students and how much
            progress they will make. In addition, I hope that the most important
            factors in my teaching career should be the ability to solve complex
            problems, teaching and learning strategies, and critical reflection.
            As shown in educational psychology textbooks, these professional
            knowledge will improve our learning and teaching quality and tell us
            how to become a qualified teacher. I hope that through the study of
            professional courses, I will observe the behavior of students in
            groups or individuals, understand their ideas, and change teaching
            strategies in time. Finally, I hope I can be guided by my mentor and
            suggestions from my friends. Because from suggestions or criticisms,
            I will get emotional and professional support.
